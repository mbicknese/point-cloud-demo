# Point cloud demo by Maarten Bicknese

To get started, either host all source files in your own web server. Or start the dev stack by running:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Assumptions

As this is a proof of concept, and a solution to a challenge, it is not a production ready application. Being so, a couple of assumptions are made.

 - All code runs in a WebGL capable browser.
 - JavaScript execution in browser is turned on and allowed.
 - Tests are skipped in favour of quick prototyping.
